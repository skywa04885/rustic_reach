# Rustic Reach Arm

## Components

### PCA9685 16-Channel, 12-Bit PWM Peripheral

This peripheral is used to control the servo's. I bought the one from [Otronic](https://www.otronic.nl/nl/16-kanaals-12-bit-pwm-servo-driver-i2c.html)

### Raspberry Pi Model 3B

This single board computer is meant to control all the hardware, and will host the server which will be used to control the servo's and the peripherals.
